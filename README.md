# Anomaly_Detector_Using_Isolation_Forest
This project presents an Anomaly Detector for Forest dataset using Isolation Forest
which comes under the package Scikit Learn. Anomalies are events that deviate
highly from the pattern or trend. Isolation Forest can be used to find anomaly or
outlier data points in any dataset. We have used a subset of 8 scenes dataset which
was used first in a paper by Oliva (click for more info). There are two folders
namely Forest and Test which are used as Training and testing datasets. There are
(256 x 256 pixels) images of forest in the Forest folder which serves as the training
dataset. Test folder consists of scenes ranging from coast and mountains to street
and tall buildings. This Anomaly Detector uses color histogram of images as
training and testing data.
